# 24Hr-Digital-Clock
This project implements a 24-hour digital clock using T flip-flops or BCD Counter, designed and simulated in NI Multisim. The clock accurately tracks and displays hours, minutes, and seconds using 7-segment displays. 
The clock initially starts from 00:00:00 and reset after 23:59:59.
